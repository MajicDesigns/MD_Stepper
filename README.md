# Library for Stepper Motors

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_OnePin.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_Stepper)

This library provide control of unipolar and bipolar stepper motors
through the appropriate hardware drivers.

Motions can be enabled in a polled mode for generic architectures or 
from an interrupt timer for AVR architectures, using either AVR 
timer 1 or 2 (selectable at compile time).

This library was designed for stepper control of motors used in robotic 
applications, running at modest step frequencies (ie the hundreds of 
Hz rather than KHz).

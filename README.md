# Library for Stepper Motors

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_OnePin.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_Stepper)

This library provides services to control unipolar and bipolar stepper 
motors through appropriate intermediate hardware drivers. It is intended
for control of motors used in robotic applications running at modest 
step frequencies (ie up to low KHz rates).

Motion can be enabled in a polled mode for generic architectures or 
from an interrupt timer for AVR architectures, using either AVR 
timer 1 or 2 (selectable at compile time).
